This API is accessed the same way as the git endpoint. e.g. if your git URL is `https://yoursite.scm.azurewebsites.net/yoursite.git`, then the API to get the list of deployments will be `https://yoursite.scm.azurewebsites.net/deployments`.

The credentials you use are the same as when you git push. See [[Deployment-credentials]] for more details.


## scm

Note: in older builds, use `/live/scm` instead of `/api/scm`

    GET /api/scm/info
    Get information about the repository
    
    POST /api/scm/clean	
    Clean the repository, using 'git clean -xdff'
    
    DELETE /api/scm	
    Delete the repository
    	
## Command

    POST /api/command
    Executes an arbitrary command line and return its output

The JSON body of the post should look like this, passing the command and the folder it should run in:

    {
        "command": 'echo Hello World',
        "dir": 'site\\repository'
    }

    	
## VFS
The VFS API is based on <https://github.com/c9/vfs-http-adapter>. Paths with trailing slashes are treated as directories.

**Note:** when updating or deleting a file, ETag behavior will apply. You can pass a `If-Match: "*"` header to disable the ETag check.

    GET /api/vfs/{path}
    Gets a file at path

    GET /api/vfs/{path}/
    Lists files at directory specified by path.

    PUT /api/vfs/{path}
    Puts a file at path.

    PUT /api/vfs/{path}/
    Creates a directory at path. The path can be nested, e.g. `folder1/folder2`.

    DELETE /api/vfs/{path}
    Delete the file at path.

## Zip
   The Zip API allows downloading folders as zip files, or expanding zip files into folders.

    GET /api/zip/{path}
    Zip up and download the specified folder. The zip doesn't include the top folder itself.

    PUT /api/zip/{path}
    Upload a zip file which gets expanded into the specified folder. Existing files are not deleted
    unless they need to be overwritten by files in the zip. The path can be nested (e.g. `folder1/folder2`), and needs to exist.

## Deployment

    GET /api/deployments
    Get the list of all deployments
    
    GET /api/deployments/{id}
    Get a deployment

    PUT /api/deployments/{id}

        {id} is optional. If not provided, redeploy the current head.
        payload (optional):
        {
          clean: false,        // optional, whether to run git clean -xdf before building

## SSHKey

    GET /api/sshkey?ensurePublicKey=1
    Generate the private/public key pair (if not already created), and return the public key as a string. e.g. "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc..."
